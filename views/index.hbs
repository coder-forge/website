      <p>Welcome to the coder forge.</p>
      <p>These events hope to provide a place for adults to learn and trade as a
      `coder`. They are open to all, from complete newbies (noobs) to advanced
      programmers (guru's).</p>

      <p>There is no set curriculum and no costs either. Because of this these weekly
      meetups will be on an open door basis.</p>

      <p>As you can see this site is a work in progress, as is the project on a whole,
      but please do drop into our next <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Coder-Forge/events/227966239/">forge</a> and see what it is all about.</p>
