                <p>Welcome to the coder forge.</p>
                <p>
                  These sessions hopes to provide a weekly space for people
                  interested in learning to code. With the current technology
                  available to us it is perfectly feasible to trade as a coder
                  whilst you learn your full skill set. No different to any
                  other apprenticeship. Also using this method gives you the
                  chance to see if coding or software development is something
                  your interested in, it gives you a chance to test the market.
                </p><p>
                  These `forges` also hope to improve the relationship between
                  the level of knowledge of the coder and the current market
                  forces. It is for this reason the forges will be based on a
                  bottom up decision making process by allowing the members to
                  decide what is thought and by whom.
                </p><p>
                  At a coder forge the format is flexible enough to change from
                  `nodejs` to `php` or from `python` to whatever the next new
                  big thing is. It is entirely up to those that are present. The
                  coder forges are modeled on the popular `coder-dojo` but with
                  a focus on adults rather than kids, and thus an ability to
                  learn where to find work, either in the locality, or online.
                  It must be noted that due to the charity nature of the coder
                  forge, all closed source projects should be left at the door,
                  all code and projects created in a coder forge are licensed
                  under MIT and Creative Commons respectively.
                </p><p>
                  We hope to provide a place for adults to learn and trade as
                  a `coder`. They are open to all, from complete newbies (noobs) to
                  advanced programmers (guru's). There is no set curriculum and no costs
                  either. Because of this these weekly meetups will be on an open door
                  basis.
                </p>

                <p>
                  These, workshops, or coder forges, are mimicked on the popular
                  Coder Dojo for kids, with the exception of being for those 17yrs
                  and up. Lessons will be thought using, predominantly, open source
                  tools and from a DevOp methodology.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>based on open source methodologies and philosophies</li>
                    <li>not tied down to one specific language or industry</li>
                    <li>community based structures where members can decide the
                      direction and format of workshops</li>
                    <li>an online portal for mentor and coder collaboration</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Coder forges are to be stress free, without any set out curriculum,
                  and they must also support and work with other open projects in
                  their locality.
                </p>

                  As you can see this site is a work in progress, as is the project on a
                  whole, but please do drop into our next meetup and see what it is all
                  about.
